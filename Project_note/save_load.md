Configuring the SavedModel
New in TensoFlow 2.4 The argument save_traces has been added to model.save, which allows you to toggle SavedModel function tracing. Functions are saved to allow the Keras to re-load custom objects without the original class definitons, so when save_traces=False, all custom objects must have defined get_config/from_config methods. When loading, the custom objects must be passed to the custom_objects argument. save_traces=False reduces the disk space used by the SavedModel and saving time.
