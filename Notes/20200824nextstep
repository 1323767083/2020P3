1 single worker GPU process, multiple worker
2.single eval GPU process, multiple eval

3. seperate potential buy price and potential sell price in support view

4. simulator fully go through eval peirod
   buy-sell
   next day buy

5. note book show change of one stock for fully go through simulator result

6. increase to 5 min 1 min


7. brain class does not need GPU percent param

Brain<--> WorkerGPU

Init same as normal?
1 Brain Set E_Update
2.Brain Wait E_Update clear
3.Brian set Worker_work      # this in not necussary now as WorkCPU is either in the wait status or in the sim status

WorkerCPUs <--> WorkerGPU
1. WorkerCPU set the Flag_wait_action
2. WorkerCPU send stat to list_workGPU_input
3. WorkerCPU wait for Flag_wait_action clear


Eval:
Eval_Main_process

Eval_main_process
check weight file avalaible
let GPU load weight
wait GOU finish load
let cpu start eval
wait CPUs finish load
